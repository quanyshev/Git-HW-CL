I been known to miss a red flag
I been known to put my lover on a pedestal
In the end, those things just don't last
And it's time I take my rose-coloured glasses off

I already know your type, tellin' me the things I like (Mm)
Tryna make me yours for life, takin' me for a ride (Mm)
I already know your type, think you playin' your cards right (Mm)
Don't you know I could do this dance all night?
